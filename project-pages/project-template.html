        <div class="body-text"></div>
        <div class="subheader-text">Problem Statement:</div>
        <div class="body-text">The owner of a jewelry shop aims to increase revenue by improving the website and predicting successful customer conversions. Key challenges include identifying the most relevant factors influencing customer purchasing behavior, such as product quality, ease of navigation, and customer service. This is vital as online sales constituted 19.4% of all retail sales in 2019, a figure accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.</div>
        <div class="body-text"></div>
        <div class="body-text">By analyzing user interactions and conversions, the project aims to explore the following questions:</div>
        <div class="body-text">🔍 1) What factors most significantly impact customer conversion rates?</div>
        <div class="body-text">💻 2) How do user behaviors, such as time spent on product-related pages, influence purchasing decisions?</div>
        <div class="body-text">📈 3) Can machine learning models reliably predict customer conversions?</div>

        <image class="project-header-image" src="../assets/NewImages/jewellery.jpg">
      </div>
        <div class="subheader-text">Project Summary:</div>
        <div class="body-text">1) Data Preparation: Dataset includes 8630 training and 3700 testing data points, covering user behavior on the jewelry shop website. Addressed missing values using mean imputation and one-hot encoded categorical variables.</div>
        <div class="body-text">2) Data Cleaning: Removed irrelevant features and handled high correlations between key attributes.</div>
        <div class="body-text">3) Feature Selection: Selected features with the highest correlation to the target variable (Revenue), such as PageValues, ExitRates, and BounceRates.</div>
        <div class="body-text">4) Model Development: Implemented base models and Ensemble Stacking techniques to predict successful conversions.</div>
